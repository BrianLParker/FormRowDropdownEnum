# Test project for my form row components

I'm trying to create a set of Blazor components to make creating well laid-out forms easier. Based on tag helpers I have for Razor pages, I have most of them working. One is giving me problems, so I created this sample project so people could see what I've done, and hopefully help me work out how to get this one working.
